A quick way to find oxygen and verify leads.

Today, a crisis ravages India
COVID-19 has overwhelmed the systems.
The government in its unpreparedness has left the citizens to deal with the crisis alone

Many Indians are offering help in the form of oxygen or beds on twitter
This can be hard to find, as when one searches for oxygen on twitter, they will find mostly requests for oxygen
This website filters through those and shows the user people who offer oxygen only. 

For now, it is only able to show oxygen, although functionality for beds and medecine will be added
It is also only available for three cities -- Delhi, Jaipur, snd Mumbai. The ability to search for any city in India will be added soon. 

This is far from a solution to the problem--
When I first scraped twitter search results, I was excited to see 100 returns - "Thank goodness! People are giving oxygen.", I thought.
93 of those were requests. 93 of those were desperate tweets begging for a basic resource to save their loved ones.
The harsh reality is that some, if not many, of those 93 will die.
